# Pmclain_EmailPreview

## About This Module
Populates variables into email template previews. When editing previously saved 
email templates, the module will add fields for store, customer email, order, invoice,
and shipment increment ids. These fields will prepopulate with the last created
instance of each. 

## Notes For User
**Beware orders, invoices and shipments, may not be related.

**The preview variable fields are not present when creating a template. Save new 
  templates and re-enter the editor for the preview variable to be visible.
